  "buy_motivation": "NVDA is the primary beneficiary of the AI infrastructure spending mentioned in the market context. Technically, the stock has shown a strong reversal from its 20-day low of $171.03, closing at $185.41 on high relative volume (1.33x), indicating institutional support. With a forward P/E of 24x against 66% earnings growth, the valuation is compelling for a 3-6 month swing. The stop loss is placed at $168.50, providing a margin below the recent structural support. Take profit levels are set at the recent high ($210) and toward the mean analyst target ($235), providing a favorable reward-to-risk ratio ahead of the Feb 25 earnings catalyst.",
